\usage{
clean_teacher_names(
  data,
  teacher_name_col = "Main Teacher Name",
  TeacherFNColumn = "Main Teacher First Name",
  TeacherLNColumn = "Main Teacher Last Name"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing class list information. Must include
teacher name columns such as `"Main Teacher Name"`, `"Main Teacher First Name"`,
and `"Main Teacher Last Name"`.}

\item{teacher_name_col}{Character string giving the name of the column
containing the teacher's full name. Defaults to `"Main Teacher Name"`.}

\item{TeacherFNColumn}{Character string giving the name of the column
containing the teacher's first name. Defaults to `"Main Teacher First Name"`.}

\item{TeacherLNColumn}{Character string giving the name of the column
containing the teacher's last name. Defaults to `"Main Teacher Last Name"`.}
}
\value{
A data frame identical to the input `data`, with all teacher name columns
converted to title case.
}
\description{
Converts all teacher name fields in a class list to title case (e.g.,
"john SMITH" becomes "John Smith"). This ensures consistent formatting across
teacher names for display, reporting, and downstream processing.
}
\details{
This function is typically used after data extraction or merging steps to
clean up inconsistent capitalization in teacher names. It is complementary
to \code{\link{clean_class_names}()} and \code{\link{reduce_to_best_teacher}()},
providing the final formatting pass before export.

If any of the specified teacher name columns are missing from the input data,
the function will stop with an informative error message.
