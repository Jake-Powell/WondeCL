\title{Revert ignored withdrawals}
\usage{
revert_ignored_withdrawals(class_list, withdraw)
}
\arguments{
\item{class_list}{A data frame of class list data (as returned by
[apply_withdrawn()]).}

\item{withdraw}{A data frame of withdrawal results (as returned by
[apply_withdrawn()]), containing the columns `classListIndex` and
`IgnoreResult`.}
}
\value{
An updated version of `class_list` with withdrawal flags and identifying
fields (`Withdrawn?`, `DoB`, `UPN`, `Print ID`, and `OME_ID`) restored
for ignored records.
}
\description{
This function removes the withdrawal flag and restores identifying fields
for students who were previously marked as withdrawn but have been flagged
to be ignored (i.e., `IgnoreResult == "Y"` in the `withdraw` table).
}
\details{
For every row in `withdraw` where `IgnoreResult == "Y"` and a valid
`classListIndex` exists, this function:
\itemize{
  \item Sets `Withdrawn?` back to `""`
  \item Restores (clears) blank fields (`DoB`, `UPN`, `Print ID`, `OME_ID`)
    to `NA` where appropriate.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
updated_class_list <- revert_ignored_withdrawals(class_list, withdraw)
}
