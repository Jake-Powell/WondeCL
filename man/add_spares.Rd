\title{Add spare rows to each class list}
\usage{
add_spares(class_list, no_spares = 3, include_spare_column = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{class_list}{A data frame containing a class list, typically produced by
\code{\link{produce_class_lists}()} or \code{\link{create_school_blanks}()}.
Must include the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item `School name`
  \item `URN`
  \item `Class Name`
  \item `Main Teacher Name`
  \item `Main Teacher First Name`
  \item `Main Teacher Last Name`
  \item `Pupil Last Name`
  \item `Pupil First Name`
}}

\item{no_spares}{Integer. The number of spare (blank) rows to add for each unique
class. Defaults to `3`.}

\item{include_spare_column}{Logical. If `TRUE`, a column named `"Spare?"`
is added to the output, with `"Y"` marking the spare rows. Defaults to
`FALSE`.}
}
\value{
A modified version of the input data frame with spare rows appended for each
unique class. If `include_spare_column = TRUE`, includes an additional
`"Spare?"` column.
}
\description{
Appends a specified number of **spare (blank)** rows to each unique class in a class list.
The spare rows inherit key identifying fields (such as school name, URN,
class name, and teacher information) to allow for manual data entry,
printing, or later updates. Optionally, a `"Spare?"` column can be added to
flag the spare entries.
}
\details{
This function is typically used to prepare finalized or printable class lists
with placeholder rows for late student additions. The spare
entries are visually grouped at the end of each class when sorted.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Add three spare entries per class
 class_list = WondeCL::class_list_example
}
