\usage{
summarise_class_sizes(
  class_list,
  school_name_col = "School name",
  urn_col = "URN",
  class_col = "Class Name",
  pupil_col = "Pupil First Name",
  unique_id_col = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{class_list}{A data frame containing at least the columns:
`"School name"`, `"URN"`, `"Class Name"`, and `"Pupil First Name"`.}

\item{school_name_col}{Column name for school names. Default: `"School name"`.}

\item{urn_col}{Column name for school URNs. Default: `"URN"`.}

\item{class_col}{Column name for class names. Default: `"Class Name"`.}

\item{pupil_col}{Column name for pupil names (used only if no unique ID column is provided).
Default: `"Pupil First Name"`.}

\item{unique_id_col}{(Optional) Column name uniquely identifying students (e.g., `"UPN"` or `"ID"`).
If provided and present in `class_list`, counts of students per class will use distinct values
in this column. If `NULL` (default), each row is assumed to represent one student.}
}
\value{
A tibble with one row per class, containing:
\describe{
  \item{School name}{School name.}
  \item{URN}{Unique reference number for the school.}
  \item{Class Name}{Name of the class.}
  \item{StudentsInClass}{Number of students in the class.}
  \item{TotalStudentsInSchool}{Total number of students in the school.}
  \item{PercentOfSchool}{Percentage of the school's total students in this class.}
}
}
\description{
Groups a class list by school and class to calculate:
\itemize{
  \item The total number of students in each class (class size).
  \item The total number of students in the school.
  \item The percentage of the school's students that belong to each class.
}
Optionally counts unique students by ID (e.g. `"UPN"` or `"ID"`).
