\title{Detect students with multiple class memberships}
\usage{
detect_multiple_class_memberships(class_list_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{class_list_df}{A data frame containing class list information,
typically the output from `extract_class_list()`. It should include
at minimum `SchoolId`, `StudentId`, `ClassId`, `ClassName`, and associated
teacher and student details.}
}
\value{
A data frame of students who are listed in more than one class, with teacher
columns removed for clarity.
}
\description{
Identifies students who appear to belong to more than one class within the
provided class list. The function runs a standard cleaning pipeline to ensure
class and teacher information are consistent before detection, then filters
for cases where the `Class Name` field contains multiple class names joined
by commas.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
  \item Cleans and standardizes class names using
        \code{\link{clean_class_names}()}.
  \item Reduces duplicate student records to the main teacher using
        \code{\link{reduce_to_best_teacher}()}.
  \item Produces a summarized class list via
        \code{\link{produce_class_lists}()}.
  \item Filters for any records where \code{Class Name} contains a comma,
        indicating multiple class associations.
}

This function is typically used as part of a quality-assurance step before
running overlap or membership consistency checks.
