\title{Detect students missing a class assignment}
\usage{
detect_students_missing_class(class_list_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{class_list_df}{A data frame containing at least the column `ClassId`
and student-level information. Typically the output of
\code{\link{extract_class_list}()} or a subsequent cleaning step.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing only those rows where the `ClassId` field is missing
(`NA`), representing students who are not assigned to any class.
}
\description{
Identifies students in the provided class list who do not have a recorded
class assignment (i.e., those with missing `ClassId` values). This function
is useful for quickly checking data completeness after class extraction or
cleaning.
}
\details{
This function is a lightweight diagnostic tool used to flag students
who have no class membership information available. It does not modify
the input data frame, only filters it.

It is commonly used prior to or in conjunction with
\code{\link{check_students_missing_class}()} or other validation
utilities that check subject-specific or year-specific class assignments.

\dontrun{
missing_class_students <- detect_students_missing_class(class_list_df)
