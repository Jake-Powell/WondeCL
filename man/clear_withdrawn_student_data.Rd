\description{
For any students marked as withdrawn (i.e., rows where the
\code{'Withdrawn?'} column equals \code{'Y'}), this function removes
identifying information by setting selected columns to \code{NA}.

Specifically, the function sets the values in \code{'UPN'}, \code{'DoB'},
\code{'Print ID'}, and \code{'OME_ID'} to \code{NA}, but only for columns
that already exist in the data frame. Missing columns are ignored.
