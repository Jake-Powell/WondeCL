\title{Extract distinct values across schools for a specified field}
\usage{
extract_field_across_schools(
  WondeData,
  field_path,
  value_name = "value",
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{WondeData}{A named list of school datasets, typically created by data retrieval
functions such as \code{\link{get_primary_school_student_data}} or
\code{\link{get_secondary_school_student_data}}.}

\item{field_path}{Character. The path to the column of interest within each Wonde dataset,
using `$` notation (e.g., "student$students.data__year.data.code").}

\item{value_name}{Character. Optional. The name to give the column containing the
distinct field values in the output (default = "value").}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE (default), prints messages about schools that were
skipped due to missing data or fields.}
}
\value{
A data frame with:
\describe{
  \item{value_name}{The distinct values extracted across all schools.}
  \item{count}{The total number of records across all schools for that value.}
  \item{school_ids}{Comma-separated list of school IDs where that value appears.}
}
}
\description{
This general-purpose function scans through a list of Wonde school datasets (`WondeData`)
and compiles a summary of all distinct values found for a user-specified field (column)
within each school's dataset.
}
\details{
For example, it can be used to summarise:
* Year codes - from `student$students.data__year.data.code`
* Group names - from `students_group$groups.data__name`
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
extract_field_across_schools(WondeData, "student$students.data__year.data.code")
extract_field_across_schools(WondeData, "students_group$groups.data__name", "group_name", verbose = FALSE)
}
