\usage{
filter_WondeData(
  WondeData,
  student_filter = NULL,
  subject_filter = NULL,
  year_fallback_column = "year.data.code",
  fallback_codes = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{WondeData}{A list of raw Wonde data, where each element represents
a single school's extracted dataset from Wonde.}

\item{student_filter}{Optional function applied to the `education_details`
element of each school list, returning the student IDs to keep.
The function should return a character vector of IDs.}

\item{subject_filter}{Optional function applied to the `subjects` element
of each school list, returning either a logical vector or IDs to keep.
Use this to retain data for specific subjects, such as Mathematics.}

\item{year_fallback_column}{A character string naming the column in
the `student` data that contains year or code information. Used to
identify students when `education_details` IDs do not match. Defaults
to `"year.data.code"`.}

\item{fallback_codes}{Optional character vector of values used for matching
in `year_fallback_column` when no students are returned by
`student_filter`. For example, `c("R", "Reception")`.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if `TRUE`, displays progress messages while filtering.}
}
\value{
A list of filtered Wonde data objects. Each element will contain only
the relevant students, teachers, and classes. The returned list also
includes an attribute named `"issue_list"`, which records any schools
where fallback rules were applied.
}
\description{
Restricts raw Wonde data to only those students, teachers, and classes
that meet user-defined filtering criteria such as year group or subject.
Designed to generalise across both primary and secondary school datasets.
