\title{Example Wonde-formatted raw data extract}
\format{
A named list of two school datasets:
\describe{
  \item{\code{S123456}}{Simulated data for *Lavandula Primary School*.}
  \item{\code{S654321}}{Simulated data for *Digitalis Purpurea Primary School*.}
}

Each school entry is a list containing:
\describe{
  \item{\code{student}}{A data frame of pupil-level information including
  \code{id}, \code{forename}, \code{surname}, \code{date_of_birth.date},
  and year group fields.}

  \item{\code{education_details}}{A data frame linking pupil IDs to their
  unique pupil numbers (\code{UPN}).}

  \item{\code{students_classes}}{A data frame describing the relationship
  between pupils, their classes, and class-level metadata (e.g. subject,
  teacher, and year group).}

  \item{\code{students_group}}{A data frame of group assignments such as
  registration or tutor groups, including the assigned teachers.}

  \item{\code{subjects}}{A data frame listing available subjects for the
  school, each identified by a subject ID.}

  \item{\code{staff}}{A data frame of staff members (teachers) associated
  with the classes and groups. Some classes include both a main and an
  assistant teacher.}
}
}
\usage{
WondeData_template
}
\description{
A simulated example of a Wonde API data extract containing multiple schools,
structured to match the output typically returned by
\code{get_primary_school_student_data()} or
\code{get_secondary_school_student_data()}.

This dataset is designed for testing, demonstrations, and development of
functions within the package that operate on Wonde-formatted data.
It mirrors the typical nested structure returned by the Wonde API, including
school-, student-, class-, and group-level elements.
}
\details{
The dataset is suitable for testing package functions such as:
\itemize{
  \item \code{\link{extract_class_list}()}
  \item \code{\link{summarise_school_data}()}
  \item \code{\link{extract_field_across_schools}()}
  \item \code{\link{extract_group_names_across_schools}()}
}

All IDs (e.g. school, student, staff, subject, class, group) are generated in
the format \code{"A#########"} (one letter followed by 7â€“10 digits), and the
values are simulated for demonstration only.
