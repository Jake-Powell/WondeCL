\title{Retrieve School Student and Staff Data from Wonde API}
\usage{
get_primary_school_student_data(school_id, KEY = "", verbose = TRUE)

get_secondary_school_student_data(school_id, KEY = "", verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{school_id}{Character string giving the Wonde school ID.}

\item{KEY}{Character string; the Wonde API key used for authentication.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if TRUE (default), prints progress messages
to the console as data are fetched.}
}
\value{
A named list of data frames, typically including:
\itemize{
  \item `student` – basic student and school info.
  \item `students_group` – student-group relationships.
  \item `students_classes` – student-class relationships and staff assignments.
  \item `subjects` – available subjects (mainly secondary).
  \item `staff` – employee information and groups.
  \item `education_details` – student education information.
}
}
\description{
Retrieves detailed student, staff, and class information from the Wonde API
for either primary or secondary schools.

These functions serve as wrappers around the Wonde v1.0 API and return
structured data frames of students, staff, and their relationships to classes,
subjects, and groups. Both functions now include education details.
}
\details{
Each function performs several authenticated API requests to Wonde for
a given `school_id`, assembling structured data on:

\itemize{
  \item **school info** – name, URN, establishment number, and phase of education.
  \item **staff (employees)** – teacher and employee data, including group memberships.
  \item **students (basic info)** – student-level data, including year group.
  \item **students + classes** – student-class relationships and associated staff.
  \item **students + groups** – student group memberships and related employees.
  \item **subjects** – subject-level metadata (typically secondary only).
  \item **education details** – student education information (available for both primary and secondary schools).
}

The functions rely on internal helpers:
\itemize{
  \item `get_query()` – handles paginated API requests.
  \item `convert_list_element_to_df()` – flattens nested list structures.
}

Any missing or NULL components are removed automatically before returning.
