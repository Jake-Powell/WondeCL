\title{Produce final formatted class lists from cleaned student data}
\usage{
produce_class_lists(
  data,
  class_name_column = "ClassName",
  default_teacher = "Reception teacher",
  default_teacher_FN = "Reception",
  default_teacher_SN = "Teacher"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing student and class information. Must
include at least the columns `SchoolId`, `StudentId`, `SchoolName`, `URN`,
the class name column specified by `class_name_column`, and teacher and
student name fields such as `TeacherName`, `TeacherForeName`,
`TeacherSurName`, `StudentFirstName`, `StudentLastName`, `DoB`, and `UPN`.}

\item{class_name_column}{Character string specifying the column to use for
class names. Default is `"ClassName"`, but `"class_name_use"` is
recommended if using `clean_class_names()`.}

\item{default_teacher}{Character string giving the default main teacher name
for records with missing teacher information. Default is `"Reception teacher"`.}

\item{default_teacher_FN}{Character string giving the default teacher first
name. Default is `"Reception"`.}

\item{default_teacher_SN}{Character string giving the default teacher surname.
Default is `"Teacher"`.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing one row per student with the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{`School name`}{The school name.}
  \item{`URN`}{Unique reference number for the school.}
  \item{`Class Name`}{The class name used in downstream processing.}
  \item{`Main Teacher Name`}{Teacher responsible for the class, with defaults
  used if missing.}
  \item{`Pupil First Name`}{The student's first name (title-cased).}
  \item{`Pupil Last Name`}{The student's surname (title-cased).}
  \item{`DoB`}{The student's date of birth.}
  \item{`UPN`}{The unique pupil number or ID if available.}
  \item{`Main Teacher First Name`}{The main teacher's first name.}
  \item{`Main Teacher Last Name`}{The main teacher's surname.}
}
}
\description{
Aggregates cleaned student, class, and teacher data into a single
standardized class list suitable for reporting or export. Each student
appears once per school, with their associated class, teacher, and unique
identifiers. Default values are used for missing teacher names, and student
names are converted to title case.
}
\details{
This function is typically the final step in the class list processing
pipeline, after functions such as `clean_class_names()` and
`reduce_to_best_teacher()`. It merges multiple records per student into
single entries, applies formatting and default values, and returns a clean,
human-readable data frame.
